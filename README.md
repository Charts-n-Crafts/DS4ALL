# Data Science for All (DS4ALL)

Welcome to DS4ALL, a repository of reference materials implemented primarily in Jupyter Notebooks aimed at providing a solid and interactive foundation in data science basics through a series of structured modules. Whether you're a beginner or looking to brush up on your skills, this repository offers resources on key tools and concepts in data science.

If the materials are too high level, first consider finding a course or learning resource from e.g. YouTube and then referring back to these materials which should offer a quick look-up of the most important concepts.

- Basic data types, variables, and operations
- Control structures: conditionals and loops
- Functions and reusable code blocks

### Data Manipulation Libraries

#### NumPy

Master NumPy, the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. Topics include:

- Array creation and manipulation
- Indexing, slicing, and iterating
- Basic operations and broadcasting

#### Pandas

Explore Pandas, a library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures, and data analysis tools. Learn about:

- Series and DataFrames
- Handling missing data
- Data aggregation and group operations
- Merging, joining, and concatenating datasets
- Data input/output

### Data Visualization

Visualize data using powerful Python libraries to gain insights and communicate findings.

#### Matplotlib

Start with Matplotlib, a plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

#### Seaborn

Advance to Seaborn, a statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

#### Plotly & Cufflinks

Explore Plotly & Cufflinks for interactive and aesthetically pleasing visualizations that can enhance the data exploration process.

### Version Control with Git

Understand the basics of Git, a version control system that lets you track changes, revert to previous stages, and collaborate with others on projects. This module covers essential Git operations and workflows to manage your code effectively.

### Further Reading and Resources

This section provides additional resources, recommended readings, and external links to further your knowledge and understanding of data science.
