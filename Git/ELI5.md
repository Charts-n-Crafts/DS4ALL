# [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) are two different things
Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based platform that lets you store and manage your Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.

## What is Git?
Software on your computer (have to download gitbash on Windows)

Git is basically a memory card for code, it allows you to save your progress as you go along. With it you can save your progress with a few simple commands

## Is Git Something I Need to Know?

Yes

## What is GitHub?

A website (like bitbucket, gitlab, etc) that allows you to store your code in the cloud, so yourself and others can access it from anywhere. It also allows you to collaborate with others on the same code.

## Basic Git Commands

- `git init` - initializes your project or directory as a git repository (think of this as inserting your memory card)

- `git add` - adds files in your working directory to your staging area (think of this as adding files to your memory card)

- `git commit` - commits the files in your staging area to your repository (think of this as saving your memory card)

- `git push` - pushes your code to your remote repository (think of this as uploading your memory card to the cloud)

- `git log` - shows a list of all previous commits

- `git status` - shows the status of your working directory and staging area

- `git checkout` - switches between branches

## Key takeways

- Make many small commits, this help prevent catastrophic losses of code, it's easier to manage conflicts on a single file than multiple and makes code changes easier to follow

Git is best learnt by doing.
